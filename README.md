# Chihuahua and muffin problem: very similar objects recognition
## Abstract
Since the 2010’s-decade deep learning field progressed by giant steps at always expected tasks such as object classification, speech recognition, text-written processing, image generation, etc. AI competitions such as the “Imagenet challenge” led to convolutional architectures became so popular when solving object recognition and classification problems, this is because of the accuracy levels reached, from around 70% in 2011 to more than 95% (better than humans even!) in 2015.<br><br>
Very similar objects recognition is not a new task for humans at all, because in nature it happens all the time: we can observe how animals use camouflage to survive, hid from preys to hunt them, and so on. However, during this report, we won’t study camouflage issues, but objects that look alike in completely different contexts: labradoodles and fried chicken, dogs and bagels, sheepdogs and mops and chihuahuas and muffins of course!
